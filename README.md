# Diabetes-Detection

<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases and possesses a threat to human health. It is the third leading cause of death. Diabetes occurs due to a rise in blood glucose levels due to insufficient insulin levels or due to the inability of the body to use insulin properly. The most common types of diabetes are Type 1, Type 2 and gestational diabetes. <br> <br>
According to the 2021 review, people living in cities and metropolitan cities in India are more likely to develop diabetes. This is mostly because of lack of exercise, eating fast foods, obesity, stress, etc. Hence, it becomes necessary to diagnose diabetes at an early stage so that proper treatment can be given to patients before it becomes critical. For early detection of diabetes, I am making a model using Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset and applying various machine learning techniques. Machine Learning is a method used to train computers and machines. It is a study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and use of data.  <br><br>

The objective of this project is to predict whether or not a person is diabetic, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. This model focuses mainly on women who are at least 21 years old.

<h2>Dataset</h2>
I will be using Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset for this project. The dataset consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable. 
Predictor variables include the following â€“
<ul>
<li>Number of pregnancies</li>      
<li>Glucose level</li>     
<li>Blood pressure</li>      
<li>Skin thickness</li>     
<li>Insulin level</li>       
<li>Body Mass Index (BMI)</li>      
<li>Diabetes Pedigree Function </li>      
<li>Age</li>       
</ul>

<br> The target variable is the outcome that consists of 0 and 1. 0 indicates that the patient is not diabetic while 1 indicates that the patient is diabetic. 
In this dataset, all the patients are females that are at least 21 years old of Pima Indian Heritage. <br>

<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
In EDA I have performed the following - 
<ol>
<li>Checking the balance of the dataset</li>
<li>Resampling</li>
<li>Checking the dataset using basic methods</li>
<li>Replacing Zeroes</li>
<li>Plotting</li>
<li>Removing Outliers</li>
<li>Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)</li>
<li>Training using Random Forest Classifier</li>
</ol>
